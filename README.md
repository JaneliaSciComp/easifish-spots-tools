# EASI-FISH pipeline tools for processing spots.

These are tools used mostly for extracting spot statistics from the CSV files generated by other spot detection tools like 'airlocalize', 'RS-FISH', or 'fishspots'

## Extract spots counts
python -m easifish_spots_tools.labeled_spots_counts

## Extract spots regions
python -m easifish_spots_tools.labeled_spots_props

## Post-processing after RS-FISH
The purpose of this tool is guarantee that after the spot extraction all spot information, no matter what tool was used for detecting the spots (whether it was airlocalize, or RS-FISH or fishspots), looks the same
